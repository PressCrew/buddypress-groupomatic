This plugin is different than other plugins with similar functionality in two very big ways:

1. It does not require any additional database tables, nor does it modify any of the existing tables.
1. The decision to match a member to a group can be based on their responses to extended profile fields.

The major features are:

* Match groups using their Name, Slug, or ID
* Match groups based on member response data using a flexible macro.
* Add members to a specific group based on a Yes/No type of field.
* Toggle automatic joining on/off without losing your settings.

A [pro version](http://shop.presscrew.com/shop/buddypress-groupomatic/) is available which adds:

* Force Edit Profile - members can't navigate the site unless their profile is complete.
* Group Activity Tab - an additional tab is added to the activity stream under which only activity for the matching group is displayed.
* Wildcard Pattern Matching - supports using meta-characters like: *, ?, [abc]
* PCRE Pattern Matching - for absolute control over the matching algorithm.
* Premium Support - get professional support directly from the plugin's author.
